# Backgound
SAT equipment qualification records are currently prepared manually using Microsoft Excel.
Inspection engineers manually copy data, drag and insert images, and reformat tables repeatedly to produce similar reports on a daily basis.
Daily inspection tasks are tracked separately from reporting documents, resulting in limited visibility of progress and potential inconsistencies.
Image evidence is stored independently from report files, which increases report preparation time and introduces risk of missing documentation.

# Objective
Develop a web-based system that:
1. Provide real-time visualization of SAT report progress, including:
 >* Number of completed inspection items
 >* Total number of inspection items
 >* Estimated completion date
2. Automatically generate daily inspection task prompts based on the original SAT inspection schedule, while allowing users to:
>* Complete tasks in advance
>* Manually select and mark tasks as completed
3. Standardize inspection data entry by generating structured input prompts based on predefined SAT inspection templates.
4. Support direct image attachment from mobile devices as inspection evidence.
5. Automatically generate a complete SAT report in Excel format with all required fields and embedded image evidence.

# Business Values
Implementation of the SAT Inspection Automation System is expected to deliver the following business benefits:

## Reduced Report Preparation Time
SAT projects typically require 3 to 5 weeks to complete, depending on equipment complexity.
By automating task planning, data entry, and report generation, the overall project duration is expected to be reduced by approximately two weeks.

## Improved Task Planning and Resource Preparation
Early visibility of daily inspection tasks enables proactive planning of required materials and test equipment, reducing delays caused by unprepared resources.

## Increased Efficiency in Documentation Handling
Automated data consolidation and image embedding significantly reduce manual effort spent on formatting, image insertion, and repetitive table generation.

## Enhanced Progress Visibility
Real-time visualization of completed versus total inspection items improves transparency for engineers and project managers.

## Improved Delivery Predictability
Better progress tracking and structured workflow reduce the risk of schedule overruns and improve on-time SAT report delivery.
